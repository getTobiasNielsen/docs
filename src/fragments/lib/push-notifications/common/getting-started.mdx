The Push Notifications category allows you to integrate push notifications in your app with Amazon Pinpoint targeting, campaign, and journey management support.

Amazon Pinpoint helps you to monitor your app's usage, create messaging campaigns and journeys targeted to specific user segments or demographics, and collect interaction metrics with push notifications.
