The Amplify Push Notifications plugin provides a simple API to record the receipt and opening of notifications within your app.

## Record Notification Received

import ios0 from "/src/fragments/lib/push-notifications/ios/record_notifications/10_notification_received.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{ios: ios0}} />

## Record Notification Opened

import ios3 from "/src/fragments/lib/push-notifications/ios/record_notifications/20_notification_opened.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{ios: ios3}} />
