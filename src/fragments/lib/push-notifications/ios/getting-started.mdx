## Requirements
1. In order to use Amazon Pinpoint you need to setup credentials (keys or certificates) for your targeted mobile platform, e.g. Android and/or iOS.
2. Testing Push Notifications requires a physical device, because simulators or emulators won't be able to handle push notifications.




## Setup for iOS

1. For setting up iOS push notifications, you need to download and install Xcode from [Apple Developer Center](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

2. Setup iOS Push Notifications and create a p12 certificate as instructed here in [Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/apns-setup.html).



### Configuration Options

- `requestIOSPermissions` is an optional boolean flag which specifies whether or not to automatically request push notifications permissions in iOS when calling `PushNotification.configure` for the first time. If not provided, it defaults to `true`. When set to `false`, you may later call the method `PushNotification.requestIOSPermissions` at the explicit point in your application flow when you want to prompt the user for permissions.
- `appId` is optional and *only* needed if `aws-exports` doesn't contain `aws_mobile_analytics_app_id` or you are manually configuring each category inside `Amplify.configure()`.
