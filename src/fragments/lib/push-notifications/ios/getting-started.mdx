## Requirements
1. In order to use Amazon Pinpoint you need to setup credentials (keys or certificates) for your targeted mobile platform, e.g. Android and/or iOS.
2. Testing Push Notifications requires a physical device, because simulators or emulators won't be able to handle push notifications.


## Setup for iOS

2. Setup iOS Push Notifications and create a p12 certificate as instructed here in [Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/apns-setup.html).
