> Prerequisite: [Install and configure the Amplify CLI](/cli/start/install)

<Callout>

If you want to use existing AWS Pinpoint resources [follow this guide](/lib/push-notifications/existing-resources) instead.

</Callout>

To start provisioning push notifications resources in the backend, go to your project directory and execute the command:

```sh
amplify add notifications
```

Choose *APNS* when promoted:

```console
? Choose the push notification channel to enable.
> APNS
FCM
Email
SMS
```

Choose *Certificate* when promoted:

```console
? Choose authentication method used for APNs
> Certificate
Key
```

The CLI will prompt for your *p12 certificate path*, enter it respectively.

Once all your configuration is complete run the following:

```sh
amplify push
```

Upon completion, `amplifyconfiguration.json` will be updated to reference the newly provisioned backend push notifications resources. Note that this file should already be a part of your project if you followed the Project Setup walkthrough.
