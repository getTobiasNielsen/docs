You can record that a user opened a push notification with Amazon Pinpoint by calling `Amplify.Notifications.Push.recordNotificationOpened(_)` from the `userNotificationCenter(_:didReceive:)` delegate method of your UNUserNotificationCenter Delegate.

First, set the UNUserNotificationCenter delegate to your Application Delegate.

```swift
func application(
        _ application: Application,
        didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data
) {  
    UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self
    // ...
}
```

Then, extend your Application Delegate to conform to `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` and add the following method.

```swift
extension AppDelegate: UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate {

    // Called when a user opens (taps or clicks) a notification.
    func userNotificationCenter(
        _ center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
        didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse
    ) async {        
        do {
            try await Amplify.Notifications.Push.recordNotificationOpened(response)
        } catch {
            print("Error recording notification opened: \(error)")
        }
    }
}
```
